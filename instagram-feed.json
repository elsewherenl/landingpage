To be taken away from everything else they crossed the Nile with. I made my greetings to everything else that bid their farewell, to kings and queens who already departed, who only chose to be buried south of here, who only chose to be carried across the west bank of the Nile, who chose to be buried into the afterlife. Who saw the intimate writings on their walls something only their souls will recognise and recall in their coming rebirth.",

Little by little, it seemed to me that it was not nature itself - eternal, wild, impenetrable - that I was drawing near, but the shifting reflection of my own drifting, and the void at the heart of my existence. Of All The Wild Paths speaks to our relationship with ourselves and the landscape. Even in the wilderness there is evidence of those who came before. Through painted silhouettes Claire traces that connection between us, the landscape, and our predecessors. Her figures appear - almost ghostly - hinting at the ethereal connection between past and present.",

The use of colour, perspective and intervention creates ambiguity that encourages new relationships with nature to emerge.",
